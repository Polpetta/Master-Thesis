\chapter{Introduction}

 Through the history of internet, many factor changed and new innovations came,
but at the end of the day a foundamental key remained: TCP/IP performance are, 
indeed, what the users unconsciously want.\todo{Idea: talk about how TCP/IP 
performes quite well in wired connections, while in wireless one, such as 
wireless/satellite, sucks ass} In this context network optimization plays an 
important role, and it is for this reason that network packets are processed 
while traversing the network in order to make their transmission as fast as 
possible. On top of that, mobile traffic is continuously surging every year, 
with the backbones having more and more data to process. In this context, 
in-hardware VNF solutions are becoming less efficent. Their time-to-deploy, in 
fact, is very high compared to the requirements of the network. With this trend, 
in-hardware solutions will not be able to keep up. Is with this considerations 
that software solutions are being proposed to become the new way to deploy 
network components. While less efficent, they are faster to bring them up, 
offering an unprecedented flexibility\footnote{SDN/NFV-Based Mobile Packet 
Core Network Architectures: A Survey}. Furthermore, new virtualization 
technologies such as Cloud computing and Docker are becoming more and more 
mature for being employed in large-scale production environments, where new 
frameworks, called orchestrators (e.g. Kubernetes, Docker Swarm), allow to 
easily manage the application lifecyle, i.e. deployment, scale up/down
and finally, removal.

\section{The VIBES project}
 
 This thesis is part of the VIBES project\todo{Talk about VIBES project, add 
some reference, explain what it is.}, where the necessity for better TCP/IP 
transmission through satellite connections is the main requirement. To 
reach this goal, the project specifications suggest to exploit the 5G incoming 
technology and use the NFV-MANO architecture to perform first packets 
elaboration and performance improvment and finally TCP/IP satellite chunk
optimization with the Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP). The VIBES project 
proposed five technical requirements\todo{Finish list!}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Analysis of the applicability of current and new Internet protocols in
the proposed VNF-PEP architecture
\end{itemize}

Starting with the first step of creating a MANO able to process incoming data 
packets through VNF functions, we encountered that many networking tools already 
present in the market required some tweaking and some integrations, shifting our 
goal to create a complete  European Telecommunications Standards Institutes 
(ETSI) Management and orchestrator (MANO) testbed instead, following the 
specifications suggested in the RFC 7665, thus implementing only the first three 
requisites, without digging in the satellite data flow optimization.
