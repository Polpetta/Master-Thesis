\label{chap:conclusions}

In this thesis we have seen an ETSI MANO implementation proposal. We have 
described the technological components needed to build it, and we have 
presented the requirements of the whole implementations. Then we described 
the challenges we have encountered and how we solved it, taking choises 
valuating the pros and cons.

Finally, we corroborated our implementation with test, showing that a 
containerized approach is faster and more reliable thant a virtualized one
